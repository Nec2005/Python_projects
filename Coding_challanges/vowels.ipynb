    "The purpose of this coding challenge is to write a program that checks if a word contains consecutive vowels or not.\n",

    "At the end of this coding challenge, students will be able to;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze a problem, identify, and apply programming knowledge for an appropriate solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement conditional statements effectively to solve a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement loops to solve a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execute operations on strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by solving the problem effectively.\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this coding challenge, you are going to write a program that takes a string and checks if it contains consecutive vowels or not. It should give `Positive` as an output if it contains consecutive vowels and `Negative` otherwise. For example `saetqi` string contains `a` adjacent to `e`, which means that it contains consecutive vowels. So it should give `Positive` as an output. On the other hand, if you take the string of `statoqag`, the output should be `Negative`.\n",
